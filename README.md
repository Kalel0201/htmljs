**HTMLjs** is a JavaScript [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript. It uses *HTML.data* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful custom controls to enable productive development. This framework is similar to [Knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com), actually it's encouraged by Knockoutjs but hundred times faster than Knockout, it's event faster than browser's rendering processing because it only uses pure javascript code, no thing such as template. You can re-use knockout source code with HTMLjs. See meal reservation example in examples folder.
