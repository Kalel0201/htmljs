**HTMLjs** is a JavaScript [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) (a modern variant of MVC) framework that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript. It uses *HTML.data* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with validation, custom controls, dynamic script loading to enable productive development. This framework is similar to [Knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com), actually it's inspired by Knockoutjs but many times faster than Knockout, maybe it's the fastest MVVM framework ever because it only uses pure javascript code, no thing such as template.
