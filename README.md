**HTMLjs** is a JavaScript [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML. It uses *observers* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of *declarative bindings* to enable productive development. This framework is similar to [Knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com) but hundred times faster than knockout, it's event faster than browser's rendering processing because it only uses pure javascript code, no thing such as template. You can re-use knockout source code with HTMLjs. See meal reservation example in examples folder.
