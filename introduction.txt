I'm delighted to announce that I've finished my MVVM framework. It's still in beta version however it'll release soon. You can download at HTMLjs.

This framework is similar to Knockoutjs but hundred times faster, it's even faster than browser's rendering processing because it only uses pure javascript code, no thing such as template. You can re-use knockout source code with HTMLjs. See meal reservation example in examples folder. You can take a look at the API, it's very beautiful and comprehensive for those familiar with Knockout.
Note that I use HTML.data instead of ko.observable and ko.observableArray and also ko.computed. And you must use each function within a container (e.g a div tag).

var vm = new ReservationsViewModel();

HTML.render(document.body)
	.h2('Your seat reservations ').span(vm.seatNum).$().$()
	.br()
	.button('Add seat').click(vm.addSeat).refreshChange(vm).$()
	.br()
	.table()
		.thead().tr().th('Passenger name').$().th('Meal').$().th('Surcharge').$().$()
		.tbody()
			.each(vm.seats, function(seat){
				HTML.render(this)
				.tr()
					.td().input(seat.name).$().$()
					.td()
						.dropdown(vm.availableMeals, seat.meal, 'mealName').refreshChange(seat, vm).$()
					.$()
					.td().span(seat.formattedPrice).$().$()
					.td().a('Remove').click(vm.removeSeat, seat).click(vm.f5).$().$()
				.$()
			})
		.$()
	.$()
